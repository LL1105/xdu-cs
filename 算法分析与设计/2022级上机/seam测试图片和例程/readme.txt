Programming Assignment 7: Seam Carving


/* *****************************************************************************
 *  Describe concisely your algorithm to find a horizontal (or vertical)
 *  seam.
 **************************************************************************** */



/* *****************************************************************************
 *  Describe what makes an image suitable to the seam-carving approach
 *  (in terms of preserving the content and structure of the original
 *  image, without introducing visual artifacts). Describe an image that
 *  would not work well.
 **************************************************************************** */



/* *****************************************************************************
 *  Perform computational experiments to estimate the running time to reduce
 *  a W-by-H image by one column and one row (i.e., one call each to
 *  findVerticalSeam(), removeVerticalSeam(), findHorizontalSeam(), and
 *  removeHorizontalSeam()). Use a "doubling" hypothesis, where you
 *  successively increase either W or H by a constant multiplicative
 *  factor (not necessarily 2).
 *
 *  To do so, fill in the two tables below. Each table must have 5-10
 *  data points, ranging in time from around 0.25 seconds for the smallest
 *  data point to around 30 seconds for the largest one.

/* *****************************************************************************
 *  Using the empirical data from the above two tables, give a formula 
 *  (using tilde notation) for the running time (in seconds) as a function
 *  of both W and H, such as
 *
 *       ~ 5.3*10^-8 * W^5.1 * H^1.5
 *
 *  Briefly explain how you determined the formula for the running time.
 *  Recall that with tilde notation, you include both the coefficient
 *  and exponents of the leading term (but not lower-order terms).
 *  Round each coefficient and exponent to two significant digits.
